Hi, I am Anomitra. I'm a **software developer** by profession. I work for [Livspace](www.livspace.com) right now, and I live in Bangalore. Just in case your interest in me goes beyond these cursory details, here is a quick lowdown.

It all started when I was a thirteen-year old kid fiddling with Logo on my dad's PC. The moment I learnt that the words `REPEAT 4 [FD 50 RT 90]` is enough to draw a whole square on my screen, it was love at first sight. I was hooked. I knew this is what I wanted to do when I grow up.

Fast-forward to now, and I'm still coding, building things and enjoying every moment of it. I don't write software for the money. I do it for the dopamine rush it gives me every time I learn something new.

I am also a sports buff in general, and a football fan in particular. I have written about football in [the](http://backpagefootball.com/steven-gerrard-leaving-liverpool-last-great-sacrifice-club/89686/) [past](https://worldsoccertalk.com/2012/07/16/how-fantasy-premier-league-can-make-you-do-things-youd-never-dream-of/), but now I leave that to sports journalists who are infinitely more qualified than me.  When I'm not writing code or watching football, you will probably find me binging my latest favourite TV show.


I will be writing about tech, productivity and anything else that catches my fancy. If you derive some value out of this haystack of words I'm churning out, that will delight me to no end.

If you wanna talk, just [drop me a mail](mailto:anomitra.s@gmail.com) or reach out on one of my socials. For the more professional people, here's my [resum√©](assets/docs/resume.pdf).
