title: What Iâ€™m Doing Right Now

### Life

As is the case with most other people, I am now **locked down**. Working from home has been a strange transition - however, I am getting used to it. I've been trying to work out regularly and eat clean. I've learnt to cook over the past few months and I'd recommend it to everyone - cooking one's own food can be borderline therapeutic. When I'm not doing one of these things, [Fortnite](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/all/CalmAsYouLike) has kept me busy.

### Work

I am working on a catalogue that aims to unify the incredibly fragmented home improvement services industry under a more conventional **storefront e-commerce solution**. It's an incredible problem to be solving. Technologically, I have been working with (and learning) Java for an year now. I've been trying out VueJS in my spare time, it looks very promising and I hope to use it one of these days.

### Music

After my EDM phase in 2018 and raging [post-rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7qS6XEMjdvRdOhhg6xQrfZ?si=bG4vAe51SViFSvD1x4ZNoQ) phase in 2019, this has been a relatively quiet year so far. I'm listening to a lot of Radiohead, some indie pop and some old favourites I've developed over the years. Someday I'll code up a widget that displays my recently played Spotify artists here.

### Books

[Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) is the book I'm reading right now, it's a dense read so I've been pacing myself. Other than that, I've started re-reading the ASOIAF series in anticipation for the next instalment.

### Television/Movies

The one show that has my attention right now is [Snowpiercer](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/snowpiercer). It's a thriller that incorporates a good deal of social commentary, and someday I hope to write about it. Until I do, Seinfeld re-runs keep me busy.
